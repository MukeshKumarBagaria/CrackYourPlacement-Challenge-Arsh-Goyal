QUESTION-
Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]


SOLUTION-
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> groupAnagrams(vector<string>& strs) {
        //i will use map 
       // as i have an array of strings so i'll traverse through the array
        //for s[i]  we will sort the string and store as key and store origanl string in vector 
        map<string,vector<string>>m;//declare an map names as m
        vector<vector<string>>ans; // vector to store answer
        int n=strs.size(); 
        //here we are storing an sorted string and respect to that we are storing all the anagram of that string using the unique key property of map
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            string s=strs[i];
            sort(s.begin(),s.end());
            m[s].push_back(strs[i]);
        }
        // through traversing whole map we are storing all the vector of map into our answer vector
        for(auto &pr:m){
            ans.push_back(pr.second);
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
