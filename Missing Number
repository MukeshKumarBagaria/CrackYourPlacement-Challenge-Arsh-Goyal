QUESTION- Missing Number

Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.


SOLUTION-
class Solution {
public:
    int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        //sum of array elements
        int sum=0;
        int n=nums.size();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            sum+=nums[i];
        }
        
        // sum from o to n;
        int sum2=(n*(n+1))/2;
        return sum2-sum;
    }
};
